
Method:
Perform DepthFirstSearch or BreadthFirstSearch (any complete graph search that keep track of visited vertices)
until it visits a vertex (the 1st time you see it) whose all connected vertices were already marked as visited.
This vertex is safe, so its removal will not disconnect the graph.

Proofs:
1)	The method is valid

	When we visit a node for the first time, all his neighbors that were already marked were reached before through another way.
	It means that we didn't need to get to the current vertex before reach its neighbors, so its removal is safe.


2)	We always find a safe vertex with this method for any connected graph with more than 2 vertex
	
	At least the last visited vertex (for the 1st time) is a safe vertex, 
	because all the other nodes will be already marked (otherwise this is not the last vertex).
